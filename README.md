# RetroSpace
A simple space shooter written in Python using the Pygame library.

Code is still rusty but the program works.
I will clean up the code when I have the time because I'm trying to shy away from the pragmatic or the "brute-force" habit I have developed when programming applications. This is basically a practicing ground for my coding skill as well as to familiarize myself with algorithmic thinking.

I am learning game design as well and I might as well apply some of the concepts I learned to this pet project.
